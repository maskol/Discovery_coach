business outcome, customer value, and the hypothesis — not detailed solution design.

Guidance:
- Keep the writing concise and outcome-focused.
- Each field should be 1–5 sentences.
- Think “hypothesis” — expect refinement as you learn.

EXAMPLE (SIMPLE, FICTIONAL)
------------------------------------------------
EPIC NAME:
Reduce Time-to-Market for New B2B Services

EPIC OWNER:
Anna Svensson, Epic Owner B2B Portfolio

BUSINESS CONTEXT / BACKGROUND:
It currently takes 9–12 months to launch new B2B services. Competitors move
faster, resulting in lost business and reduced competitiveness.

PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY:
B2B customers perceive us as slow. Internally, there are many handovers,
manual coordination steps, and unclear responsibilities.

TARGET CUSTOMERS / USERS:
- External mid-market B2B customers
- Internal sales and product management teams

EPIC HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT:
For B2B sales and product teams
who spend 9-12 months launching new services due to fragmented processes
the Time-to-Market Acceleration Epic
is a standardized value stream with clear ownership and reduced handovers
that enables launches in under 7 months
unlike our current ad-hoc approach with multiple disconnected teams
our solution significantly improves competitiveness and unlocks new revenue opportunities
by allowing us to launch twice as many services with better quality

DESIRED BUSINESS OUTCOMES:
- Reduce average time-to-market from ~10 months to <7 months
- Increase number of new B2B offers from 4 to 7 per year
- Improve win-rate by 10 percentage points

LEADING INDICATORS:
- Number of initiatives using the new standardized flow
- Number of handovers per initiative
- Cycle time per step

MVP (MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT):
MVP FEATURES:
- Document and map current B2B service launch process for 2 representative services
- Identify top 3 bottlenecks and design streamlined flow
- Pilot new flow with 1-2 new service launches

MVP SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Reduce time-to-market by at least 20% for pilot services
- Achieve 80% satisfaction score from pilot teams
- Identify and document minimum 5 process improvements

MVP TIMELINE:
3 months (Q1 2026)

MVP TARGET USERS:
- 2 B2B product teams launching new services in Q1
- Sales enablement team

FORECASTED FULL SCOPE:
FULL CAPABILITIES:
- Standardized end-to-end launch process across all B2B services
- Automated workflow tools and templates
- Cross-functional launch team model with clear ownership
- Self-service launch portal for product teams
- Integrated measurement dashboard

FULL ROLLOUT PLAN:
- Phase 1 (MVP): 1-2 pilot services - Q1 2026
- Phase 2: Expand to 5 additional services - Q2 2026
- Phase 3: Full rollout to all B2B product teams - Q3-Q4 2026

ESTIMATED TIMELINE:
12 months from MVP start to full implementation

EXPECTED BENEFITS AT FULL SCALE:
- Consistent <7 month time-to-market for all B2B services
- 7+ new services launched per year (vs. current 4)
- 15% improvement in win-rate
- 30% reduction in coordination overhead

SCOPE / OUT OF SCOPE:
IN SCOPE:
- Analysis of current B2B service-delivery flows
- Design of standardized launch flow(s)
- Alignment between business and IT

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Large-scale system modernization
- Pricing model changes

BUSINESS IMPACT & VALUE ASSUMPTIONS:
Faster time-to-market unlocks new revenue opportunities and reduces
coordination cost.

RISKS, ASSUMPTIONS & CONSTRAINTS:
ASSUMPTIONS:
- Business stakeholders will adopt new ways of working.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Limited availability of key SMEs during Q2–Q3.

KEY RISKS:
- Resistance to change
- Underestimation of complexity

WSJF – HIGH LEVEL:
BUSINESS / USER VALUE: 18
TIME CRITICALITY: 15
RISK REDUCTION: 13
JOB SIZE: 8

METRICS & MEASUREMENT PLAN:
Primary KPIs:

- Number of B2B launches

Secondary KPIs:
- Win-rate
- Internal satisfaction with new workflows

Follow-up plan:
- First measurement after 6 months
- Full impact review after 12 months
