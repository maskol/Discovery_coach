╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

When creating an Epic, be prepared to answer these questions:

1. EPIC NAME
   - What is a clear, descriptive name for this epic?
   - Example: "Mobile Payment Processing", "Customer Self-Service Portal"

2. PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY
   - What specific problem are you solving or opportunity are you addressing?
   - What pain points do current customers experience?
   - Example: "Customers spend 15 minutes per transaction using legacy system"

3. TARGET CUSTOMERS / USERS
   Define the specific customer segment(s) this epic serves:
   
   - Customer Type: B2B, B2C, internal users, partners?
   - Segment Demographics: Age range, industry, company size, role/title?
   - Geographic Location: Country, region, urban/rural, specific markets?
   - Behavioral Characteristics: Usage patterns, tech-savviness, purchase behavior?
   - Psychographics: Pain points, motivations, goals, values?
   - Quantitative Details: How many users/customers? Market size? Growth rate?
   - Current Context: What's their current workflow/situation? What tools do they use today?
   
   Examples:
   - "B2C residential customers in rural northern Sweden (Norrbotten, Västerbotten regions), 
     ~15,000 users, remote workers aged 25-55, currently experiencing connectivity issues 
     affecting productivity, high churn risk (30%)"
   - "Internal operations team (50 users) in finance department, processing 10K transactions/day, 
     currently using legacy desktop software, frustrated with 15-minute processing times"
   - "Small business owners (B2B), 500-5000 employees, manufacturing sector in EMEA, 
     seeking to reduce operational costs, currently using manual processes"

4. BUSINESS OUTCOME (MUST BE MEASURABLE)
   Definition: The measurable benefits that the business can anticipate if the epic 
   hypothesis is proven to be correct.
   
   - What specific, measurable business result will this achieve?
   - Include: metric, target percentage/number, and time frame
   - Examples:
     * "Reduce operational cost by 25% within 1 year"
     * "Increase customer satisfaction score from 72 to 85 (Q2 2026)"
     * "Reduce transaction time from 15 min to 5 min (within 6 months)"
     * "Increase revenue by $2M annually"

5. LEADING INDICATORS
   Definition: The early measures that will help predict the business outcome hypothesis.
   
   - What early signals show progress toward the business outcome?
   - These should lead the outcome by weeks/months
   - Include specific metrics and targets
   - Examples:
     * "User adoption rate reaches 80% (leading indicator for efficiency)"
     * "Average task completion time drops below 8 minutes"
     * "Support tickets related to process drop by 40%"
     * "System uptime stays above 99.5%"

6. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
   - Performance: Response time < 200ms? Throughput capacity?
   - Reliability: Uptime target (e.g., 99.9%)? Disaster recovery?
   - Security: Data encryption? Compliance (GDPR, PCI-DSS)?
   - Scalability: Support how many concurrent users? Data volume?
   - Usability: Mobile support? Accessibility standards?
   - Examples:
     * "Response time < 200ms for 99th percentile"
     * "99.9% uptime SLA"
     * "GDPR and PCI-DSS compliant"
     * "Support 10,000 concurrent users"

7. EPIC HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT
   - Use this structured format to articulate your solution:
   
   For <customers>
   who <do something>
   the <solution>
   is a <something – the 'how'>
   that <provides this value>
   unlike <competitor, current solution or non-existing solution>
   our solution <does something better — the 'why'>
   
   - Example:
     For operations teams
     who spend excessive time on manual payment processing
     the Mobile Payment Processing Epic
     is a real-time automated payment platform
     that reduces transaction time from 15 minutes to under 5 minutes
     unlike manual data entry and batch processing systems
     our solution enables customers to complete transactions instantly, 
     freeing them for higher-value activities

8. CONSTRAINTS / RISKS
   - What might prevent success?
   - Technical constraints?
   - Resource limitations?
   - External dependencies?
   - Regulatory/compliance risks?
   - Examples:
     * "Legacy system integration required"
     * "Data migration complexity"
     * "Regulatory approval needed"
