╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PI (Planning Interval   ) Context:
- Duration: 10 weeks of development + 3 weeks for planning/innovation/retrospective
- Features should be completable within the 10-week PI (average 3-5 weeks per feature)
- PI Objectives are derived from Epics and their decomposed Features
- PI Objectives MUST be SMART:
  * Specific: Clearly defined outcome, no ambiguity
  * Measurable: Quantifiable metrics to track progress and success
  * Achievable: Realistic within the 10-week PI timeframe and team capacity
  * Relevant: Aligned with business strategy and value streams (from parent Epic)
  * Time-bound: Must be achievable within the single PI (10 weeks)

Relationship to Epics and Features:
- Epics define the strategic initiative (large, multi-PI initiatives)
- Features are decomposed from Epics (deliverable within 3-5 weeks)
- PI Objectives are the specific, measurable commitments for Features to be delivered this PI
- Multiple Features from one or more Epics may contribute to a single PI Objective
- PI Objectives must remain meaningful even if scope changes

When creating PI Objectives, be prepared to answer these questions:

1. OBJECTIVE NAME
   - What is a clear, compelling name for this PI Objective?
   - Should reflect the Features being delivered from the parent Epic
   - Should be inspiring and results-oriented
   - Should describe the RESULT, not the work
   - Avoid naming features or technical components

   Good examples:
   - “Improve onboarding success for mid-market B2B customers”
   - “Reduce provisioning errors for enterprise connectivity services”

2. PARENT EPIC(S) & FEATURES
   - Which Epic(s) does this PI Objective support?
   - Which specific Features from the Epic are included in this PI?
   - How do these Features contribute to the Epic's business outcomes?
   - Example: 
     * "Epic: Rural Connectivity Improvement"
     * "Features: 5G SA Network Deployment (Norrbotten), Customer Premises Equipment Upgrade, Real-time Connection Monitoring"
     * "Contributes to Epic goal: Reduce churn from 30% to 5% and improve NPS to +30"

2. PARENT EPIC(S) & FEATURES
   - Which Epic(s) does this PI Objective support?
   - Which specific Features from the Epic are included in this PI?
   - How do these Features contribute to the Epic's business outcomes?
   - Example: 
     * "Epic: Rural Connectivity Improvement"
     * "Features: 5G SA Network Deployment (Norrbotten), Customer Premises Equipment Upgrade, Real-time Connection Monitoring"
     * "Contributes to Epic goal: Reduce churn from 30% to 5% and improve NPS to +30"

3. BUSINESS VALUE / STRATEGIC THEME
   - Which strategic theme or business priority does this objective support? (Lean, Innovation, Core)
   - How does this align with the parent Epic's business goals?
   - What portion of the Epic's value will be delivered in this PI?
   - Why is this objective important in THIS PI?
   - What problem or opportunity does it address?
   - Example: "Operational Excellence theme - delivers 40% of Epic value by enabling remote work quality parity with office"

3. TARGET AUDIENCE / STAKEHOLDERS
   - Who is responsible for achieving this?
   - Who are the key stakeholders?
   - Example: "Operations team, Finance, Executive leadership"

4. MEASURABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA (SMART)
   - What specific, quantifiable metrics define success?
   - Include baseline, target, and timeframe (single PI = 10 weeks)
   - Must be achievable within the PI duration
   - Ensure criteria are SMART:
     * Specific: Clear, unambiguous outcome
     * Measurable: Quantifiable with concrete metrics
     * Achievable: Realistic given team capacity and 10-week timeframe
     * Relevant: Supports strategic business goals
     * Time-bound: Completion within this PI (10 weeks)
   - Examples:
     * "Reduce process cost from $50K to $35K per month by end of PI"
     * "Increase customer satisfaction NPS from 65 to 75 within 10 weeks"
     * "Achieve 99.5% system availability throughout the PI"
     * "Onboard 500 new customers by PI completion"

5. KEY RESULTS (3-5 items)
   - Break down the objective into measurable outcomes
   - Each should correspond to Features being delivered
   - Each should be independently measurable and achievable within 10 weeks
   - Features typically take 3-5 weeks, plan accordingly
   - Each should be SMART
   - Examples:
     * "KR1: Deploy 5G SA network in Norrbotten region (Feature: 5G SA Network Deployment, complete by week 5)"
     * "KR2: Install and activate customer premises equipment for 2,000 customers (Feature: CPE Upgrade, complete by week 8)"
     * "KR3: Launch real-time connection monitoring dashboard (Feature: Connection Monitoring, complete by week 6)"
     * "KR4: Achieve 95% video call success rate in pilot areas by PI end"

6. DEPENDENCIES & CONSTRAINTS
   - What internal/external dependencies exist?
   - What constraints might impact success?
   - Examples:
     * "Depends on legacy system migration completion"
     * "Requires vendor partnership approval"
     * "Budget constraint of $500K"
     * "Resource availability limited due to other initiatives"

7. LEADING INDICATORS
   - What interim measures predict success?
   - Track these during the PI to ensure on-track trajectory
   - Examples:
     * "Weekly adoption rate tracking"
     * "Daily processing volume metrics"
     * "Team velocity/burndown trends"
     * "Customer feedback scores"

8. STRETCH GOAL (Optional)
   - What ambitious additional outcome would represent exceptional success?
   - Only pursue if core objective is on track
   - Example: "Reduce processing time to 3 seconds AND achieve 95% automation"
