EPIC EVALUATION PROMPT
======================

You are evaluating an Epic against SAFe best practices. Provide a thorough, constructive evaluation focusing on:

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. EPIC NAME
   - Is it short, clear, and descriptive?
   - Does it capture the essence of what's being built?
   - Avoid generic names like "Test", "Example", "Min Epic"

2. EPIC HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT
   - Does it follow the SAFe format: "For [customers] who [need], the [solution] is a [category] that [benefit]. Unlike [alternative], our solution [key differentiator]"?
   - Is it clear and testable?
   - Does it articulate customer value?

3. BUSINESS OUTCOME
   - Are outcomes measurable and specific? (e.g., "Increase conversion by 15%", not just "yes")
   - Are they tied to business value?
   - Can progress be tracked?

4. PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY
   - Is the problem or opportunity clearly articulated?
   - Avoid placeholder values like "No", "maybe", or unclear text
   - Should describe what customer/business problem is being solved

5. TARGET CUSTOMERS/USERS
   - Are specific personas, segments, or user groups identified?
   - Avoid vague responses like "maybe" or "customers"
   - Should be concrete and actionable

6. MVP SCOPE
   - Is the minimum viable product clearly defined?
   - Avoid unclear terms or placeholders
   - Should describe the smallest testable increment

7. LEADING INDICATORS
   - Are there early signals to measure progress?
   - Are they specific and measurable?

EVALUATION APPROACH:
- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Recognize when content appears to be placeholder/test data vs real Epic content
- Focus on what would make this Epic actionable and valuable
- Provide concrete examples of improvements
- Highlight both strengths and areas for improvement
- If content appears incomplete or placeholder, suggest what real content should look like

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide evaluation in this structure:
1. Overall Assessment (2-3 sentences)
2. Strengths (bulleted list)
3. Areas for Improvement (bulleted list with specific suggestions)
4. Key Questions to Address (3-5 targeted questions)
5. Recommended Next Steps (actionable items)
