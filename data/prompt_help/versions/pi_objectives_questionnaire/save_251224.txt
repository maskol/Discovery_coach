╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PI (Planning Interval) Context:
- Duration: 10 weeks of development + 3 weeks for planning/innovation
- Features should be completable within the 10-week PI (typically 3-5 weeks each)
- PI Objectives are derived from Epics and their Features
- All objectives MUST be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. OBJECTIVE NAME
   - What is a clear, compelling name for this PI Objective?
   - Should describe the RESULT, not the work
   - Should reflect value from the parent Epic
   
   Examples:
   - "Improve onboarding success for mid-market B2B customers"
   - "Reduce provisioning errors for enterprise connectivity services"

2. PARENT EPIC(S) & FEATURES
   - Which Epic(s) does this PI Objective support?
   - Which specific Features from the Epic are included in this PI?
   - How do these Features contribute to the Epic's business outcomes?
   
   Example: 
   * Epic: "Rural Connectivity Improvement"
   * Features: "5G SA Network Deployment (Norrbotten), Customer Premises Equipment Upgrade"
   * Contributes to: "Reduce churn from 30% to 5% and improve NPS to +30"

3. BUSINESS VALUE & STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
   - Which strategic theme does this support? (Lean, Innovation, Core)
   - What portion of the Epic's value will be delivered in this PI?
   - Why is this objective important THIS PI?
   
   Example: "Operational Excellence theme - delivers 40% of Epic value"

4. TARGET AUDIENCE & STAKEHOLDERS
   - Who is responsible for achieving this?
   - Who are the key stakeholders?
   
   Example: "Operations team, Finance, Executive leadership"

5. MEASURABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA (SMART)
   - What specific, quantifiable metrics define success?
   - Include baseline, target, and timeframe (10 weeks)
   - Must be achievable within the PI duration
   
   Examples:
   * "Reduce process cost from $50K to $35K per month by PI end"
   * "Increase customer NPS from 65 to 75 within 10 weeks"
   * "Achieve 99.5% system availability throughout the PI"

6. KEY RESULTS (3-5 items)
   - Break down the objective into measurable outcomes
   - Each should correspond to Features being delivered
   - Each must be achievable within 10 weeks
   
   Examples:
   * "KR1: Deploy 5G SA network in Norrbotten (complete by week 5)"
   * "KR2: Install CPE for 2,000 customers (complete by week 8)"
   * "KR3: Launch monitoring dashboard (complete by week 6)"

7. DEPENDENCIES & CONSTRAINTS
   - What internal/external dependencies exist?
   - What constraints might impact success?
   
   Examples:
   * "Depends on legacy system migration completion"
   * "Budget constraint of $500K"

8. LEADING INDICATORS
   - What interim measures predict success during the PI?
   
   Examples:
   * "Weekly adoption rate tracking"
   * "Team velocity/burndown trends"

9. STRETCH GOAL (Optional)
   - What ambitious additional outcome would represent exceptional success?
   - Only pursue if core objective is on track
   
   Example: "Achieve 95% automation in addition to core objective"
