When creating Features, be prepared to answer these questions:

1. FEATURE NAME
   - What is a clear, concise name for this feature?
   - Should be user-facing and meaningful
   - Example: "One-Click Payment", "Recurring Transaction Setup"

2. SHORT DESCRIPTION
   - What does this feature do in 2-3 sentences?
   - Focus on the capability, not the technology
   - Example: "Allows users to save payment methods and reuse them for 
              future transactions with a single click"

3. BENEFIT HYPOTHESIS
   - How does this feature deliver value to users?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Example: "Reduces checkout time and increases conversion rate"

4. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (Gherkin Format)
   - Write acceptance criteria as testable scenarios using Gherkin syntax
   - Format: Given [context], When [action], Then [expected result]
   - Write 3-5 scenarios that cover the main use cases
   
   Example:
   
   Scenario: User saves a payment method during checkout
     Given the user is on the checkout page
     When the user enters payment details and selects "Save for future transactions"
     Then the payment method is saved to the user's account
     And the system displays a confirmation message
   
   Scenario: User reuses a saved payment method
     Given the user has a saved payment method
     When the user initiates a new transaction
     Then the saved payment method appears in a dropdown list
     And the user can select it with one click
   
   Scenario: User deletes a saved payment method
     Given the user views their saved payment methods
     When the user selects "Delete" on a saved payment method
     Then the payment method is permanently removed
     And the user is asked to confirm the deletion
   
   Scenario: Transaction completes quickly with saved method
     Given the user has selected a saved payment method
     When the user confirms the transaction
     Then the payment is processed in less than 3 seconds
     And the user receives a confirmation
   
   Scenario: Feature works on mobile and desktop
     Given the user is on a mobile device
     When the user follows the checkout flow
     Then all features work identically to desktop
     And the interface is responsive and easy to use
